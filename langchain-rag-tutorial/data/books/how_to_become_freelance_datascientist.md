## Do what you love.

## Anywhere. Anytime.

Are you a data scientist who has been working
from 9 to 5+ for as long as you can remember?

Do you feel there might be a better way to make
the best of your time and knowledge?

Are you ready for a new adventure?

If the answers to these questions is yes, this
ebook is for you.


```
higher learning speed, as you are constantly
taking in new projects and working with
different technologies.
```
```
opportunity to work with cutting-edge
startups, without having to leave in a small
room in San Francisco.
```
```
freedom to organize your days, weeks, and
months, plus no one is counting how many
vacation days you have taken off this year.
```
```
higher hourly rates, which translate into
higher paychecks at the end of the month
```
The transition from your current 9-to-5 job to
remote freelancing is a liberating experience.

The ultimate payoff is immense, including:

## Why freelancing?


```
How can I find clients?
```
```
How can I showcase and prove I can help
them, and get the project?
```
```
How should I price my services? How much
should I charge?
```
```
What about interviews, how should I prepare
for them?
```
Becoming a freelancer is also challenging,
though, and full of mental hurdles and shadowed
by impostor syndrome.

This is why most people still work (and live) in
the 9-5 world.

The most common questions are:

Do not panic. I had all these fears too.

And I managed to overcome them with the 5-step
approach I will share with you.

Let’s get to it!

```
Why freelancing?
```

## Step 1

## Start small

```
I need someone to scrape a website
Looking for experts in Power BI
Open position for ML engineer, with focus on
CV
Experts in TensorFlow for NLP project
```
There are lots of freelance data science jobs
online. A quick search on a site like Upwork will
show you hundreds/thousands of clients looking
for some kind of data science expertise.

Data science is a vast field, with very diverse
profiles and skills. This is something every data
scientist should be thankful for, by the way.

It is likely you have a decent knowledge in several
of these areas, and you might be tempted to
apply for every single project where you think you
will deliver results.


This is what I initially tried, and the results were
pretty disappointing.

I was able to get interviews with clients, but none
of them landed me the project. I spent countless
hours writing application letters and proposals
but did not manage to convince a single client.

What was the problem?

Looking back I see it very clearly: I was not
playing on my strengths. Instead, I was applying
to every single project where I thought I could do
the job, and presenting myself as the all-in-one
data scientist.

The problem is that most clients do not look for
an all-in-one data scientist, but someone who can
help them solve their specific problems.

Eventually, I sat down and defined what were the
things inside data science I was **already an
expert in.**

And it was a no-brainer.

```
Step 1. Start small
```

In my previous job, I had spent countless hours
building dashboards in Tableau, to help the
marketing team monitor and optimize
campaigns.

This was not the kind of work I was dreaming of
when I started my freelance path, but it was
something I was an expert in.

Two weeks later after this epiphany, I landed my
first freelance contract.

My first freelance job could be crudely described
as

##### “None of our data engineers can build a

##### pretty dashboard in Tableau. Can you?”

This was not the most exciting job I could think
of, but something I had done thousand times in
my previous job. I was an expert in that, and this
is what has value for the client.

I had 0 doubts I could get the job done.

```
Step 1. Start small
```

```
Building dashboards with Tableau.
Training ML models for Computer Vision.
Scrapping websites
Or deploying a data pipeline in Google Cloud.
... among others
```
My advice is the following:

Before you start looking for jobs, you need to
define the thing(s) you are already an expert in,
for example:

Data science is a huge market. By narrowing your
profile you are still fishing in a pretty large pond.
Keep that in mind.

Start your path by focusing on projects you feel
super positive about. Avoid impostor syndrome,
earn your first check, and build up confidence.

Working part-time, or even hourly, you can earn
the same as in your previous 9-to-5. Use this as
an opportunity to learn new skills in your extra
time, in preparation for the next area you want to
work in with your next contract.

```
Step 1. Start small
```

Nowadays, most of my freelance work revolves
around building and deploying ML models. This
is something I wanted to do from the beginning,
but I got there step by step.

Start small and expand.

```
Step 1. Start small
```

## Step 2

## Minimum Viable

## Portfolio

When I started looking for freelance jobs I did not
have a public portfolio of projects to prove my
expertise to clients.

And sadly for me, this is the one thing that clients
were most interested in.

##### “I see in your LinkedIn profile you worked on

##### time/series. Can you show me what you

##### built?”

Clients want to see real work and projects you
have completed in the past. They want to see
solid proof you can deliver.

Unless you have public projects available on the
Internet like open-source contributions, public
apps, or dashboards on Tableau Public, you will
need to bootstrap something.


When my first client was interviewing me, he
asked:

##### “Can you show me a dashboard you built

##### with Tableau in your previous job?”

At that moment, I realized I had saved on my
laptop a few screenshots of the dashboards I had
built in my previous job. I was pretty lucky there.

I guided him through the logic and design
choices I made to build it. And I convinced him I
was the guy for the job. This is how I landed my
first job.

If you are planning to start a freelance career, you
should start **collecting and saving assets** you
can showcase to future clients.

They will come in very handy as you start having
interviews.

```
Step 2. Minimum Viable Portfiolio
```

```
Create a public repository on GitHub
Push the code, and
Write a well-structured README (this is very
important!)
```
You can store these privately, in Google Drive, or
put them on the internet for everyone to see.

Obviously, you need to remove any confidential
data or information linked to the project, to avoid
legal issues.

If you wanna showcase ML code you have
developed in the past, I recommend you

```
1.
2.
3.
```
The purpose of this README file is to explain to
your client (usually a non-technical guy) how your
ML work helps solve a business problem.

Start your readme focusing on **WHAT** you are
trying to solve, then you jump on to the **HOW** you
solve it.

```
Step 2. Minimum Viable Portfiolio
```

```
Google Colab notebook or
an app in HuggingFace Spaces.
```
```
Power BI Data Stories Gallery
Tableau Public
```
You can go one step further and publish your ML
work as a

Your client will be able to use the product right
away, without any git pull or local setups.

Using a product is much more convincing than
just hearing about it.

If you are a data visualization expert you can
publish your dashboards to public repositories,
like

Again, letting your client see and interact with the
final product is the most powerful way to
convince her.

```
Step 2. Minimum Viable Portfiolio
```

Landing your first job is the hardest. Then things
get easier.

Build a small public/private portfolio that focuses
on your strengths. Every new project you land is
another entry in your portfolio. Keep valuable
assets and re-package them to showcase to
future clients.

Making them publicly accessible will make your
life easier, especially at the beginning of your
freelance path.

```
Step 2. Minimum Viable Portfiolio
```

## Step 3

## Fish in several ponds

```
volume-based platforms
quality-based platforms
```
Nowadays there are lots of freelance platforms
you can use to find clients and projects.

I have used 3 of them (Upwork, Toptal, and
Braintrust), but feel free to explore others as well.

These platforms can be classified into 2 groups:

#### Volume-based platforms

The largest platform of this kind is **Upwork**.

There are no entry barriers both for clients and
freelancers. Anyone can publish a job, and
anyone can register as a freelancer.

It is a good place to find small projects, but quite
hard to get good clients when you start.


Good jobs are usually open only to applicants
who have built a reputation inside the platform
through previous projects. This puts you at a
disadvantage, and can frankly get quite
frustrating when you start.

Nonetheless, I suggest you create a profile in
Upwork. Upwork clients can find your profile
through a search inside the platform, and directly
ask you to send a proposal. This is an option you
have to leave open.

#### Quality-based platforms

The best platform is **Toptal** , followed by
**Braintrust**.

They have fewer clients but with much higher
quality. In order to see and apply for projects
inside these platforms, you need to pass a
screening process.

It takes around 2 to 5 weeks to complete. It is
time and energy-consuming, but the payoff is
immense.

```
Step 3. Fish in several ponds
```

```
You open a profile on Upwork and open the
door to direct client requests, as well as the
opportunity to apply every week to 10 jobs
you are already an expert in.
```
```
At the same time, you apply to join Toptal
and prepare for their screening process. If
you wanna know more details on their
application process, I recommend you read
this article.
```
```
If you get a rejection from Toptal, I suggest
you apply for Braintrust. They are the fastest-
growing freelance platform, and they are
rapidly adding high-quality clients to the
platform, mostly American startups and big
enterprises.
```
Being inside these platforms gives you the
opportunity to connect with great clients, usually
startups and big enterprises, who are willing to
pay higher rates for the quality that these
platforms promise them.

My recommendation is the following:

```
Step 3. Fish in several ponds
```

## Step 4

## Writing proposals

```
defined your niche,
built a minimal portfolio you can showcase,
and
found an interesting project you would like to
work on
```
Imagine you followed the previous steps. So, you
have

The next step is to write a proposal to land an
interview with the client.

You want to convince her you are worth having
an interview with, and hopefully, start working
together.

The question is:

##### How do you write project proposals that

##### open the door to an interview?


A common mistake is to start a proposal like this:

###### Dear X.

###### My name is Y, and I am a data scientist with N

###### years of experience in A, B, C and D.

###### I have a background in E, and ...

Sure. Your potential client would like to know
about your incredible background. But she is not
your mom or dad.

She wants to get the problem solved, so go
straight to the point. Focus on the problem from
the first paragraph, without preambles and
presentations that can only make her yawn.

Use bullet points to enumerate very specific
things that are directly related to the problem and
to decrease the cognitive load.

Also, keep BS to the minimum. Do you enjoy
reading how someone else praises herself?
Same for your potential client.

```
Step 4. Writing proposals
```

###### Project alpha

###### Project beta

###### Project gamma ...

In my experience, the proposals that earned me a
job had a similar structure, where I first focused
on the client's problem, and then I connected it
with relevant projects I have worked on and can
showcase later in the interview.

I close the proposal with a subtle call to action,
inviting her for a follow-up.

Example.

###### Hi X,

###### My name is Y. I believe your problem can be

###### solved by using an ML model I have a lot of

###### experience with. It overcomes the actual

###### issues, adds value to what you do, and finally

###### earns you more trust, clients, and money.

###### I have built N things recently that are directly

###### related to your problem Z:

```
Step 4. Writing proposals
```

**_I would love to help you with this one. Let’s set a
call this week to get into the specifics._**

**_Best, Y_**

I recommend you save every project proposal
you send, no matter the outcome. This way you
keep track of what works and what doesn't and
helps you improve over time.

```
Step 4. Writing proposals
```

## Step 5

## Pricing

When you open a profile in any of these freelance
platforms you set your hourly rate: how many
USD you want to be paid per one hour of work.

You might be tempted to think:

###### “Let’s try to increase my chances of landing my

###### first job by setting a lower rate than what I

###### think makes sense given my skills AND cost of

###### living.”

Big mistake. And, by the way, I made that
mistake, twice. In my second freelance project, I
was working with another data engineer, in the
same time zone, whose salary more than
doubled mine. He was working freelance for the
first time.

Countless times I regretted my smart pricing.


```
If you have previously worked on a 9-5 basis,
you can take your old monthly gross salary
and divide it by the number of hours you
worked per month. Your freelance hourly rate
cannot go lower than that.
```
Most clients are willing to pay higher rates to
decrease project uncertainty. Yours is a highly
qualified job, and **excessive price discounts are
interpreted by the client as higher uncertainty** on
the project’s success.

Also, keep in mind you are trying to convince
another human, not a cost-minimizing android.

You need to show confidence, and setting a
lower price than what you think you are worth is
the opposite of that.

A couple of tricks to find the hourly rate that
works for you:

```
Step 5. Pricing
```

```
Based on what I have seen in the market,
hourly rates for data science should not go
lower than $40 USD per hour and can get up
to $100-$150 per hour. The exact number
depends on your seniority and also on your
geo location.
```
Feel free to experiment on this, but never go
below 40 USD/hour.

```
Step 5. Pricing
```

## Conclusion

Freelance remote work as a data scientist is
incredibly rewarding, both intellectually and
financially. It can be bumpy at the beginning, but
once you overcome the initial challenges, it will
be difficult for you to imagine that you have
worked any other way.

With the right attitude and persistence, I know
you can get there.

It would give me immense pleasure if any of this
advice helped you in your freelance path.
